feel free to correct it if i have wrong code or explanation

edible mushroom classification wit bayesian Learning
The Equation of bayesian is below
![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?P%28A%7CB%29%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7BP%28B%7CA%29*P%28A%29%7D%7BP%28B%29%7D) (1)
P(A|B) = probabiliy of A happen if B is true
<br/>
P(A) and P(B) = probabiliy of A and B <br/>
in bayesian learning we can say that A is Class and B is data so the equation will be :
$$P(Ci|X) = \frac{P(X|Ci)*P(Ci)}{P(X)}$$ (2)
we know that we use the same data for testing it becomes P(X) for Ci has the same probability the equation will be like below :
$$P(Ci|X) = {P(X|Ci)*P(Ci)}$$ (3)
where i = categorical of class
